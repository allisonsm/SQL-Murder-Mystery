/* Step 1: Retrieving crime scene report:
 - Using the preset query I discovered the database has the tables: 
        - crime_scene_report
        - drivers_license
        - facebook_event_checkin
        - interview
        - get_fit_now_member
        - get_fit_now_checkin
        - solution
        - income
        - person
First I looked at the crime scene table: */

SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report
LIMIT 20;

/* Then I looked for the report using the only information we know about the murder: that it took place on January 15th, 2018 in SQL City */

SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE date = 20180115 OR date = 20181501;

/* After determining the date format, I narrowed it down: */

SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE date = 20180115 AND city = "SQL City";
