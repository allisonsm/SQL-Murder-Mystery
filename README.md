# SQL-Murder-Mystery
This is a breakdown of the queries I used to solve the [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/) game!

### SPOILER ALERT
Do not read the queries page if you want to figure out the solution on your own! I utilized comments to keep track of clues as I found them, so they are not spoiler-free.
